/**
 * Emits a value from the source Observable only after a particular time span
 * has passed without another source emission.
 *
 * <span class="informal">It's like {@link delay}, but passes only the most
 * recent value from each burst of emissions.</span>
 *
 * ![](debounceTime.png)
 *
 * `debounceTime` delays values emitted by the source Observable, but drops
 * previous pending delayed emissions if a new value arrives on the source
 * Observable. This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the
 * source Observable, and emits that only when `dueTime` enough time has passed
 * without any other value appearing on the source Observable. If a new value
 * appears before `dueTime` silence occurs, the previous value will be dropped
 * and will not be emitted on the output Observable.
 *
 * This is a rate-limiting operator, because it is impossible for more than one
 * value to be emitted in any time window of duration `dueTime`, but it is also
 * a delay-like operator
