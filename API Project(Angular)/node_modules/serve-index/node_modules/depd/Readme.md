/**
 * A reference to an Angular application running on a page.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * {@a is-stable-examples}
 * ### isStable examples and caveats
 *
 * Note two important points about `isStable`, demonstrated in the examples below:
 * - the application will never be stable if you start any kind
 * of recurrent asynchronous task when the application starts
 * (for example for a polling process, started with a `setInterval`, a `setTimeout`
 * or using RxJS operators like `interval`);
 * - the `isStable` Observable runs outside of the Angular zone.
 *
 * Let's imagine that you start a recurrent task
 * (here incrementing a counter, using RxJS `interval`),
 * and at the same time subscribe to `isStable`.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *      filter(stable => stable)
 *   ).subscribe(() => console.log('App is stable now');
 *   interval(1000).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, `isStable` will never emit `true`,
 * and the trace "App is stable now" will never get logged.
 *
 * If you want to execute something when the app is stable,
 * you have to wait for the application to be stable
 * before starting your polling process.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     tap(stable => console.log('App is stable now')),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, the trace "App is stable now" will be logged
 * and then the counter starts incrementing every second.
 *
 * Note also that this Observable runs outside of the Angular zone,
 * which means that the code in the subscription
 * to this Observable will not trigger the change detection.
 *
 * Let's imagine that instead of logging the counter value,
 * you update a field of your component
 * and display it in its template.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => this.value = counter);
 * }
 * ```
 * As the `isStable` Observable runs outside the zone,
 * the `value` field will be updated properly,
 * but the template will not be refreshed!
 *
 * You'll have to manually trigger the change detection to update the template.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => {
 *     this.value = counter;
 *     cd.detectChanges();
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Or make the subscription callback run inside the zone.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, zone: NgZone) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => zone.run(() => this.value = counter));
 * }
 * ```

     * Bootstrap a component onto the element identified by its selector or, optionally, to a
     * specified element.
     *
     * @usageNotes
     * ### Bootstrap process
     *
     * When bootstrapping a component, Angular mounts it onto a target DOM element
     * and kicks off automatic change detection. The target DOM element can be
     * provided using the `rootSelectorOrNode` argument.
     *
     * If the target DOM element is not provided, Angular tries to find one on a page
     * using the `selector` of the component that is being bootstrapped
     * (first matched element is used).
     *
     * ### Example
     *
     * Generally, we define the component to bootstrap in the `bootstrap` array of `NgModule`,
     * but it requires us to know the component while writing the application code.
     *
     * Imagine a situation where we have to wait for an API call to decide about the component to
     * bootstrap. We can use the `ngDoBootstrap` hook of the `NgModule` and call this method to
     * dynamically bootstrap a component.
     *
     * {@example core/ts/platform/platform.ts region='componentSelector'}
     *
     * Optionally, a component can be mounted onto a DOM element that does not match the
     * selector of the bootstrapped component.
     *
     * In the following example, we are providing a CSS selector to match the target element.
     *
     * {@example core/ts/platform/platform.ts region='cssSelector'}
     *
     * While in this example, we are providing reference to a DOM node.
