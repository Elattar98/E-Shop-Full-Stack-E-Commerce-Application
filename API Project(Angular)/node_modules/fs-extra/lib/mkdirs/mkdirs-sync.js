/**
 * Convert an object into an Observable of `[key, value]` pairs.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Turn entries of an object into a stream.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/pairs.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `pairs` takes an arbitrary object and returns an Observable that emits arrays. Each
 * emitted array has exactly two elements - the first is a key from the object
 * and the second is a value corresponding to that key. Keys are extracted from
 * an object via `Object.keys` function, which means that they will be only
 * enumerable keys that are present on an object directly - not ones inherited
 * via prototype chain.
 *
 * By default these arrays are emitted synchronously. To change that you can
 * pass a {@link SchedulerLike} as a second argument to `pairs`.
 *
 * @example <caption>Converts a javascript object to an Observable</caption>
 * ```ts
 * import { pairs } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const obj = {
 *   foo: 42,
 *   bar: 56,
 *   baz: 78
 * };
 *
 * pairs(obj)
 * .subscribe(
 *   value => console.log(value),
 *   err => {},
 *   () => console.
