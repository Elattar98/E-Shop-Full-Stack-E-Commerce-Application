 * Compare [CSS Keyframe Animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * In the following example, the offset values describe
 * when each `backgroundColor` value is applied. The color is red at the start, and changes to

 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the provided offset values

 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black", offset: 1 })
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * If there are no `offset` values specified in the style entries, the offsets
 * are calculated automatically.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red" }) // offset = 0
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue" }) // offset = 0.33
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange" }) // offset = 0.66
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black" }) // offset = 1

 *  - `query(":enter")` or `query(":leave")` : Query for newly inserted/removed elements (not
 *     all elements can be queried via these tokens, see
 *     [Entering and Leaving Elements](#entering-and-leaving-elements))
 *  - `query(":animating")` : Query all currently animating elements.
 *  - `query("@triggerName")` : Query elements that contain an animation trigger.
 *  - `query("@*")` : Query all elements that contain an animation triggers.
 *  - `query(":self")` : Include the current element into the animation sequence.
 *
 * @param animation One or more animation steps to apply to the queried element or elements.
 * An array is treated as an animation sequence.
 * @param options An options object. Use the 'limit' field to limit the total number of
 * items to collect.
 * @return An object that encapsulates the query data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Multiple Tokens
 *
 * Tokens can be merged into a combined query selector string. For example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, @subTrigger', [...])
 * ```
 *
 * The `query()` function collects multiple elements and works internally by using
 * `element.querySelectorAll`. Use the `limit` field of an options object to limit
 * the total number of items to be collected. For example:
 *
 * ```js
 * query('div', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { limit: 1 })
 * ```
 *
 * By default, throws an error when zero items are found. Set the
 * `optional` flag to ignore this error. For example:
 *
 * ```js
 * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { optional: true })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Entering and Leaving Elements
 *
 * Not all elements can be queried via the `:enter` and `:leave` tokens, the only ones
 * that can are those that Angular assumes can enter/leave based on their own logic
 * (if their insertion/removal is simply a consequence of that of their parent they
 * should be queried via a different token in their parent's `:enter`/`:leave` transitions).
 *
 * The only elements Angular assumes can enter/leave based on their own logic (thus the only
 * ones that can be queried via the `:enter` and `:leave` tokens) are:
 *  - Those inserted dynamically (via `ViewContainerRef`)
 *  - Those that have a structural directive (which, under the hood, are a subset of the above ones)
 *
 * <div class="alert is-helpful">
 *
 *  Note that elements will be successfully queried via `:enter`/`:leave` even if their
 *  insertion/removal is not done manually via `ViewContainerRef`or caused by their structural
 *  directive (e.g. they enter/exit alongside their parent).
 *
 * </div>
 *
 * <div class="alert is-important">
 *
 *  There is an exception to what previously mentioned, besides elements entering/leaving based on
 *  their own logic, elements with an animation trigger can always be queried via `:leave` when
 * their parent is also leaving.
 *
 * </div>
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 *
 * The following example queries for inner elements and animates them
 * individually using `animate()`.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'inner',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [@queryAnimation]="exp">
 *       <h1>Title</h1>
 *       <div class="content">
 *         Blah blah blah

 *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *
 *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one
 *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 }))),
 *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 }))),

 *
 * ### State Change Expression
 *
 * The State Change Expression instructs Angular when to run the transition's animations, it can
 *either be
 *  - a string with a specific syntax
 *  - or a function that compares the previous and current state (value of the expression bound to
 *    the element's trigger) and returns `true` if the transition should occur or `false` otherwise
 *
 * The string format can be:
 *  - `fromState => toState`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur then the
 *    expression bound to the trigger's element goes from `fromState` to `toState`
 *
 *    _Example:_
 *      ```typescript
 *        transition('open => closed', animate('.5s ease-out', style({ height: 0 }) ))
 *      ```
 *
 *  - `fromState <=> toState`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur then
 *    the expression bound to the trigger's element goes from `fromState` to `toState` or vice versa
 *
 *    _Example:_
 *      ```typescript
 *        transition('enabled <=> disabled', animate('1s cubic-bezier(0.8,0.3,0,1)'))
 *      ```
 *
 *  - `:enter`/`:leave`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur when the
 *    element enters or exists the DOM
 *
 *    _Example:_
 *      ```typescript
 *        transition(':enter', [
 *          style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *          animate('500ms', style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *        ])
 *      ```
 *
 *  - `:increment`/`:decrement`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur when
 *    the numerical expression bound to the trigger's element has increased in value or decreased
 *
 *    _Example:_
 *      ```typescript
 *        transition(':increment', query('@counter', animateChild()))
 *      ```
 *
 *  - a sequence of any of the above divided by commas, which indicates that transition's animations
 *    should occur whenever one of the state change expressions matches
 *
 *    _Example:_
 *      ```typescript
 *        transition(':increment, * => enabled, :enter', animate('1s ease', keyframes([
 *          style({ transform: 'scale(1)', offset: 0}),
 *          style({ transform: 'scale(1.1)', offset: 0.7}),
 *          style({ transform: 'scale(1)', offset: 1})
 *        ]))),
 *      ```
 *
 * Also note that in such context:
 *  - `void` can be used to indicate the absence of the element
 *  - asterisks can be used as wildcards that match any state
 *  - (as a consequence of the above, `void => *` is equivalent to `:enter` and `* => void` is
 *    equivalent to `:leave`)
 *  - `true` and `false` also match expression values of `1` and `0` respectively (but do not match
 *    _truthy_ and _falsy_ values)
 *
 * <div class="alert is-helpful">
 *
 *  Be careful about entering end leaving elements as their transitions present a common
 *  pitfall for developers.
 *
 *  Note that when an element with a trigger enters the DOM its `:enter` transition always
 *  gets executed, but its `:leave` transition will not be executed if the element is removed
 *  alongside its parent (as it will be removed "without warning" before its transition has
 *  a chance to be executed, the only way that such transition can occur is if the element
 *  is exiting the DOM on its own).
 *
 *
 * </div>
 *
 * ### Animating to a Final State
 *
 * If the final step in a transition is a call to `animate()` that uses a timing value
 * with no `style` data, that step is automatically considered the final animation arc,
 * for the element to reach the final state, in such case Angular automatically adds or removes
 * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.
 *
 *
 * ### Usage Examples
 *
 *  - Transition animations applied based on
 *    the trigger's expression value
 *
 *   ```HTML
 *   <div [@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">
 *    ...
 *   </div>
 *   ```
 *
 *   ```typescript
 *   trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *     ..., // states
 *     transition("on => off, open => closed", animate(500)),
 *     transition("* <=> error", query('.indicator', animateChild()))
 *   ])
 *   ```
 *
 *  - Transition animations applied based on custom logic dependent
 *    on the trigger's expression value and provided parameters
 *
 *    ```HTML
 *    <div [@myAnimationTrigger]="{
 *     value: stepName,
 *     params: { target: currentTarget }
 *    }">
 *     ...
 *    </div>
 *    ```
 *
 *    ```typescript
 *    trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *      ..., // states
 *      transition(
 *        (fromState, toState, _element, params) =>
 *          ['firststep', 'laststep'].includes(fromState.toLowerCase())
 *          && toState === params?.['target'],
 *        animate('1s')

 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component makes use of the defined trigger
 * by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using an inline function
 * The `transition` animation method also supports reading an inline function which can decide
 * if its associated animation should be run.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // this method is run each time the `myAnimationTrigger` trigger value changes.
 * function myInlineMatcherFn(fromState: string, toState: string, element: any, params: {[key:
 string]: any}): boolean {
 *   // notice that `element` and `params` are also available here
 *   return toState == 'yes-please-animate';
 * }
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('myAnimationTrigger', [
 *       transition(myInlineMatcherFn, [
 *         // the animation sequence code
 *       ]),
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "yes-please-animate";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations
 * When true, the special animation control binding `@.disabled` binding prevents
 * all animations from rendering.
 * Place the  `@.disabled` binding on an element to disable
 * animations on the element itself, as well as any inner animation triggers
 * within the element.
 *
 * The following example shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When `@.disabled` is true, it prevents the `@childAnimation` trigger from animating,
 * along with any inner animations.
 *
 * ### Disable animations application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled,
 * **all** inner components have their animations disabled as well.
 * This means that you can disable all animations for an app
 * by placing a host binding set on `@.disabled` on the topmost Angular component.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '@angular/core';
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   @HostBinding('@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Overriding disablement of inner animations
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can `query()`
 * for inner elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate
 * them if needed. This is also the case for when a sub animation is
 * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.
 *
 * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled
 * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation
 * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides
 * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,
 * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.
