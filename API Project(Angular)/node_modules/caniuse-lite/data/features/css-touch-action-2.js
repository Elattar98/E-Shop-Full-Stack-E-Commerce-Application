/**
 * Registers a synthetic host listener (e.g. `(@foo.start)`) on a component or directive.
 *
 * This instruction is for compatibility purposes and is designed to ensure that a
 * synthetic host listener (e.g. `@HostListener('@foo.start')`) properly gets rendered
 * in the component's renderer. Normally all host listeners are evaluated with the
 * parent component's renderer, but, in the case of animation @triggers, they need
 * to be evaluated with the sub component's renderer (because that's where the
 * animation triggers are defined).
 *
 * Do not use this instruction as a replacement for `listener`. This instruction
 * only exists to ensure compatibility with the ViewEngine's host binding behavior.
 *
 * @param eventName Name of the event
 * @param listenerFn The function to be called when event emits
 * @param useCapture Whether or not to use capture in event listener
 * @param eventTargetResolver Function that returns global target information in case this listener
 * should be attached to a global object like window, document or body
 *
