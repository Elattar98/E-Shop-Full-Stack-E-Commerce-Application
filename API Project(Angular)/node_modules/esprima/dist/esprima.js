     * Decorator that marks a class as an Angular directive.
     * You can define your own directives to attach custom behavior to elements in the DOM.
     *
     * The options provide configuration metadata that determines
     * how the directive should be processed, instantiated and used at
     * runtime.
     *
     * Directive classes, like component classes, can implement
     * [life-cycle hooks](guide/lifecycle-hooks) to influence their configuration and behavior.
     *
     *
     * @usageNotes
     * To define a directive, mark the class with the decorator and provide metadata.
     *
     * ```ts
     * import {Directive} from '@angular/core';
     *
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: 'my-directive',
     * })
     * export class MyDirective {
     * ...
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ### Declaring directives
     *
     * In order to make a directive available to other components in your application, you should do
     * one of the following:
     *  - either mark the directive as [standalone](guide/standalone-components),
     *  - or declare it in an NgModule by adding it to the `declarations` and `exports` fields.
     *
     * ** Marking a directive as standalone **
     *
     * You can add the `standalone: true` flag to the Directive decorator metadata to declare it as
     * [standalone](guide/standalone-components):
     *
     * ```ts
     * @Directive({
     *   standalone: true,
     *   selector: 'my-directive',
     * })
     * class MyDirective {}
     * ```
     *
     * When marking a directive as standalone, please make sure that the directive is not already
     * declared in an NgModule.
     *
     *
     * ** Declaring a directive in an NgModule **
     *
     * Another approach is to declare a directive in an NgModule:
     *
     * ```ts
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: 'my-directive',
     * })
     * class MyDirective {}
     *
     * @NgModule({
     *   declarations: [MyDirective, SomeComponent],
     *   exports: [MyDirective], // making it available outside of this module
     * })
     * class SomeNgModule {}
     * ```
     *
     * When declaring a directive in an NgModule, please make sure that:
     *  - the directive is declared in exactly one NgModule.
     *  - the directive is not standalone.
     *  - you do not re-declare a directive imported from another module.
     *  - the directive is included into the `exports` field as well if you want this directive to be
     *    accessible for components outside of the NgModule.

 *    - and a function to invoke.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```
 * const hostBindingOpCodes = [
 *   ~30,                               // Select element 30

 *   50, 55, OtherDir.ɵdir.hostBindings // Invoke host bindings on OtherDire on element 30
 *                                      // directiveIdx = 50; bindingRootIdx = 55;
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * ## Pseudocode
 * ```
 * const hostBindingOpCodes = tView.hostBindingOpCodes;
 * if (hostBindingOpCodes === null) return;
 * for (let i = 0; i < hostBindingOpCodes.length; i++) {
 *   const opCode = hostBindingOpCodes[i] as number;

 *     // Negative numbers are element indexes.
 *     setSelectedIndex(~opCode);
 *   } else {
 *     // Positive numbers are NumberTuple which store bindingRootIndex and directiveIndex.
 *     const directiveIdx = opCode;
 *     const bindingRootIndx = hostBindingOpCodes[++i] as number;
 *     const hostBindingFn = hostBindingOpCodes[++i] as HostBindingsFunction<any>;

/**
 * Stores DOM operations which need to be applied to update DOM render tree due to changes in
 * expressions.
 *
 * The basic idea is that `i18nExp` OpCodes capture expression changes and update a change
 * mask bit. (Bit 1 for expression 1, bit 2 for expression 2 etc..., bit 32 for expression 32 and
 * higher.) The OpCodes then compare its own change mask against the expression change mask to
 * determine if the OpCodes should execute.
 *
 * NOTE: 32nd bit is special as it says 32nd or higher. This way if we have more than 32 bindings
 * the code still works, but with lower efficiency. (it is unlikely that a translation would have
 * more than 32 bindings.)
 *
 * These OpCodes can be used by both the i18n block as well as ICU sub-block.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * Assume
 * ```ts
 *   if (rf & RenderFlags.Update) {
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp1); // If changed set mask bit 1
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp2); // If changed set mask bit 2
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp3); // If changed set mask bit 3
 *    i18nExp(ctx.exp4); // If changed set mask bit 4
 *    i18nApply(0);            // Apply all changes by executing the OpCodes.
 *  }
 * ```
 * We can assume that each call to `i18nExp` sets an internal `changeMask` bit depending on the
 * index of `i18nExp`.
 *
 * ### OpCodes
 * ```ts
 * <I18nUpdateOpCodes>[
 *   // The following OpCodes represent: `<div i18n-title="pre{{exp1}}in{{exp2}}post">`
 *   // If `changeMask & 0b11`

 * (possibly by creating) a default value of the parameterized type `T`. This sets up the
 * `InjectionToken` using this factory as a provider as if it was defined explicitly in the
 * application's root injector. If the factory function, which takes zero arguments, needs to inject
 * dependencies, it can do so using the `inject` function.
 * As you can see in the Tree-shakable InjectionToken example below.
 *
 * Additionally, if a `factory` is specified you can also specify the `providedIn` option, which
 * overrides the above behavior and marks the token as belonging to a particular `@NgModule`. As
 * mentioned above, `'root'` is the default value for `providedIn`.
 *

     * See: `DECLARATION_VIEW` which points to the actual `LView` where it was declared, whereas
     * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` points to the component which may not be same as
     * `DECLARATION_VIEW`.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```
     * <#VIEW #myComp>
     *  <div *ngIf="true">
     *   <ng-template #myTmpl>...</ng-template>
     *  </div>
     * </#VIEW>
     * ```
     * In the above case `DECLARATION_VIEW` for `myTmpl` points to the `LView` of `ngIf` whereas
     * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` points to `LView` of the `myComp` which owns the template.
     *
     * The reason for this is that all embedded views are always check-always whereas the component
     * view can be check-always or on-push. When we have a transplanted view it is important to
     * determine if we have transplanted a view from check-always declaration to on-push insertion
     * point. In such a case the transplanted view needs to be added to the `LContainer` in the
     * declared `LView` and CD during the declared view CD (in addition to the CD at the insertion
     * point.) (Any transplanted views which are intra Component are of no interest because the CD
     * strategy of declaration and insertion will always be the same, because it is the same
     * component.)
     *
     * Queries already track moved views in `LView[DECLARATION_LCONTAINER]` and
     * `LContainer[MOVED_VIEWS]`. However the queries also track `LView`s which moved within the same
     * component `LView`. Transplanted views are a subset of moved views, and we use
     * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` to differentiate them. As in this example.
     *
     * Example showing intra component `LView` movement.
     * ```
     * <#VIEW #myComp>
     *   <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
     *   <ng-template #thenBlock>Content to render when condition is true.</ng-template>
     *   <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when condition is false.</ng-template>
     * </#VIEW>
     * ```
     * The `thenBlock` and `elseBlock` is moved but not transplanted.
     *
     * Example showing inter component `LView` movement (transplanted view).
     * ```
     * <#VIEW #myComp>
     *   <ng-template #myTmpl>...</ng-template>
     *   <insertion-component [template]="myTmpl"></insertion-component>
     * </#VIEW>
     * ```
     * In the above example `myTmpl` is passed into a different component. If `insertion-component`
     * instantiates `myTmpl` and `insertion-component` is on-push then the `LContainer` needs to be
     * marked as containing transplanted views and those views need to be CD as part of the
     * declaration CD.
     *
     *
     * When change detection runs, it iterates over `[MOVED_VIEWS]` and CDs any child `LView`s where
     * the `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` of the current component and the child `LView` does not match
     * (it has been transplanted across components.)
     *
     * Note: `[DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW]` points to itself if the LView is a component view (the
     *       simplest / most common case).
     *

/**
 * A function optionally passed into the `NgForOf` directive to customize how `NgForOf` uniquely

 *
 * `NgForOf` needs to uniquely identify items in the iterable to correctly perform DOM updates
 * when items in the iterable are reordered, new items are added, or existing items are removed.
 *
 *
 * In all of these scenarios it is usually desirable to only update the DOM elements associated
 * with the items affected by the change. This behavior is important to:
 *
 * - preserve any DOM-specific UI state (like cursor position, focus, text selection) when the
 *   iterable is modified
 * - enable animation of item addition, removal, and iterable reordering
 * - preserve the value of the `<select>` element when nested `<option>` elements are dynamically
 *   populated using `NgForOf` and the bound iterable is updated
 *
 * A common use for custom `trackBy` functions is when the model that `NgForOf` iterates over
 * contains a property with a unique identifier. For example, given a model:
 *
 * ```ts
 * class User {
 *   id: number;
 *   name: string;
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 * a custom `trackBy` function could look like the following:
 * ```ts
 * function userTrackBy(index, user) {
 *   return user.id;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A custom `trackBy` function must have several properties:
 *
 * - be [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) (be without side effects, and always
 * return the same value for a given input)
 * - return unique value for all unique inputs
 * - be fast

 * This is a branded number which contains previous and next index.
 *
 * When we come across styling instructions we need to store the `TStylingKey` in the correct
 * order so that we can re-concatenate the styling value in the desired priority.
 *
 * The insertion can happen either at the:
 * - end of template as in the case of coming across additional styling instruction in the template
 * - in front of the template in the case of coming across additional instruction in the
 *   `hostBindings`.
 *
 * We use `TStylingRange` to store the previous and next index into the `TData` where the template
 * bindings can be found.
 *
 * - bit 0 is used to mark that the previous index has a duplicate for current value.
 * - bit 1 is used to mark that the next index has a duplicate for the current value.
 * - bits 2-16 are used to encode the next/tail of the template.
 * - bits 17-32 are used to encode the previous/head of template.
 *
 * NODE: *duplicate* false implies that it is statically known that this binding will not collide
 * with other bindings and therefore there is no need to check other bindings. For example the
 * bindings in `<div [style.color]="exp" [style.width]="exp">` will never collide and will have
 * their bits set accordingly. Previous duplicate means that we may need to check previous if the
 * current binding is `null`. Next duplicate means that we may need to check next bindings if the
 * current binding is not `null`.
 *
 * NOTE: `0` has special significance and represents `null` as in no additional pointer.

/**
 * Store the static values for the styling binding.
 *
 * The `TStylingStatic` is just `KeyValueArray` where key `""` (stored at location 0) contains the
 * `TStylingKey` (stored at location 1). In other words this wraps the `TStylingKey` such that the
 * `""` contains the wrapped value.
 *
 * When instructions are resolving styling they may need to look forward or backwards in the linked
 * list to resolve the value. For this reason we have to make sure that he linked list also contains
 * the static values. However the list only has space for one item per styling instruction. For this
 * reason we store the static values here as part of the `TStylingKey`. This means that the
 * resolution function when looking for a value needs to first look at the binding value, and than
 * at `TStylingKey` (if it exists).
 *
 * Imagine we have:
 *
 * ```
 * <div class="TEMPLATE" my-dir>
 *
 * @Directive({
 *   host: {
 *     class: 'DIR',
 *     '[class.dynamic]': 'exp' // ɵɵclassProp('dynamic', ctx.exp);
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * In the above case the linked list will contain one item:
 *
 * ```
 *   // assume binding location: 10 for `ɵɵclassProp('dynamic', ctx.exp);`
 *   tData[10] = <TStylingStatic>[
 *     '': 'dynamic', // This is the wrapped value of `TStylingKey`
 *     'DIR': true,   // This is the default static value of directive binding.
 *   ];
 *   tData[10 + 1] = 0; // We don't have prev/next.
 *
 *   lView[10] = undefined;     // assume `ctx.exp` is `undefined`
 *   lView[10 + 1] = undefined; // Just normalized `lView[10]`
 * ```
 *
 * So when the function is resolving styling value, it first needs to look into the linked list
 * (there is none) and than into the static `TStylingStatic` too see if there is a default value for
 * `dynamic` (there is not). Therefore it is safe to remove it.
 *
 * If setting `true` case:
 * ```
 *   lView[10] = true;     // assume `ctx.exp` is `true`
 *   lView[10 + 1] = true; // Just normalized `lView[10]`
 * ```
 * So when the function is resolving styling value, it first needs to look into the linked list
 * (there is none) and than into `TNode.residualClass` (TNode.residualStyle) which contains
 * ```
 *   tNode.residualClass = [
 *     'TEMPLATE': true,
 *   ];
 * ```
 *
 * This means that it is safe to add class.
