# validate-npm-package-name

Give me a string and I'll tell you if it's a valid `npm` package name.

This package exports a single synchronous function that takes a `string` as
input and returns an object with two properties:

- `validForNewPackages` :: `Boolean`
- `validForOldPackages` :: `Boolean`
