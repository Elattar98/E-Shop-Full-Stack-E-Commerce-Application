### API

#### <a name="ls"></a> `> cacache.ls(cache) -> Promise<Object>`

Lists info for all entries currently in the cache as a single large object. Each
entry in the object will be keyed by the unique index key, with corresponding
[`get.info`](#get-info) objects as the values.

##### Example

```javascript
cacache.ls(cachePath).then(console.log)
// Output
{
  'my-thing': {
    key: 'my-thing',
    integrity: 'sha512-BaSe64/EnCoDED+HAsh=='
    path: '.testcache/content/deadbeef', // joined with `cachePath`
    time: 12345698490,
    size: 4023948,
    metadata: {
      name: 'blah',
      version: '1.2.3',
      description: 'this was once a package but now it is my-thing'
    }
  },
  'other-thing': {
    key: 'other-thing',
    integrity: 'sha1-ANothER+hasH=',
    path: '.testcache/content/bada55',
    time: 11992309289,
    size: 111112
  }
}
```

#### <a name="ls-stream"></a> `> cacache.ls.stream(cache) -> Readable`

Lists info for all entries currently in the cache as a single large object.

This works just like [`ls`](#ls), except [`
