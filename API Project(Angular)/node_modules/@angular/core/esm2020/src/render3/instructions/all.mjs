/**
 * Injects a token from the currently active injector.
 * `inject` is only supported during instantiation of a dependency by the DI system. It can be used
 * during:
 * - Construction (via the `constructor`) of a class being instantiated by the DI system, such
 * as an `@Injectable` or `@Component`.
 * - In the initializer for fields of such classes.
 * - In the factory function specified for `useFactory` of a `Provider` or an `@Injectable`.
 * - In the `factory` function specified for an `InjectionToken`.
 *
 * @param token A token that represents a dependency that should be injected.
 * @param flags Optional flags that control how injection is executed.
 * The flags correspond to injection strategies that can be specified with
 * parameter decorators `@Host`, `@Self`, `@SkipSef`, and `@Optional`.
 * @returns the injected value if operation is successful, `null` otherwise.
 * @throws if called outside of a supported context.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * In practice the `inject()` calls are allowed in a constructor, a constructor parameter and a
 * field initializer:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
 * export cl
