/**
 * Returns an Observable that skips items emitted by the source Observable until a second Observable emits an item.
 *
 * The `skipUntil` operator causes the observable stream to skip the emission of values until the passed in observable emits the first value.
 * This can be particularly useful in combination with user interactions, responses of http requests or waiting for specific times to pass by.
 *

 * Internally the `skipUntil` operator subscribes to the passed in observable (in the following called *notifier*) in order to recognize the emission
 * of its first value. When this happens, the operator unsubscribes from the *notifier* and starts emitting the values
