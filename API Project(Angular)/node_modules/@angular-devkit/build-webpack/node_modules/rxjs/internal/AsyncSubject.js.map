## Behavioral Differences from Ruby Sass

There are a few intentional behavioral differences between Dart Sass and Ruby
Sass. These are generally places where Ruby Sass has an undesired behavior, and
it's substantially easier to implement the correct behavior than it would be to
implement compatible behavior. These should all have tracking bugs against Ruby
Sass to update the reference behavior.

1. `@extend` only accepts simple selectors, as does the second argument of
   `selector-extend()`. See [issue 1599][].

2. Subject selectors are not supported. See [issue 1126][].

3. Pseudo selector arguments are parsed as `<declaration-value>`s rather than
   having a more limited custom parsing. See [issue 2120][].

4. The numeric precision is set to 10. See [issue 1122][].

5. The indented syntax parser is more flexible: it doesn't require consistent
   indentation across the whole document. See [issue 2176][].

6. Colors do not support channel-by-channel arithmetic. See [issue 2144][].

7. Unitless numbers aren't `==` to unit numbers with the same value. In
   addition, map keys follow the same logic as `==`-equality
