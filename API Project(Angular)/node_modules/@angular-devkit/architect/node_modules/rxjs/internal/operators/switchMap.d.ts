 or `<textarea>`,
     * where whitespace characters are significant.
     *
     * Note that these transformations can influence DOM nodes layout, although impact
     * should be minimal.
     *
     * You can override the default behavior to preserve whitespace characters
     * in certain fragments of a template. For example, you can exclude an entire
     * DOM sub-tree by using the `ngPreserveWhitespaces` attribute:
     *
     * ```html
     * <div ngPreserveWhitespaces>
     *     whitespaces are preserved here
     *     <span>    and here </span>
     * </div>
     * ```
     *
     * You can force a single space to be preserved in a text node by using `&ngsp;`,
     * which is replaced with a space character by Angular's template
     * compiler:
     *
     * ```html
     * <a>Spaces</a>&ngsp;<a
