 SourceMap spec says this should be first.

            this.sources = out.sources;

                this.sourcesContent = out.sourcesContent;
            }
        }
        toString() {
            return JSON.stringify(this);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Traces through all the mappings in the root sourcemap, through the sources
     * (and their sourcemaps), all the way back to the original source location.
     *
     * `loader` will be called every time we encounter a source file. If it returns
     * a sourcemap, we will recurse into that sourcemap to continue the trace. If
     * it returns a falsey value, that source file is treated as an original,
     * unmodified source file.
