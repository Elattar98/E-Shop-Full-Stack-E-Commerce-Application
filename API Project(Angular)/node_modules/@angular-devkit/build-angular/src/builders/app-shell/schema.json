 * Emits a value from the source Observable, then ignores subsequent source

 *
 * ![](throttleTime.png)
 *
 * `throttleTime` emits the source Observable values on the output Observable
 * when its internal timer is disabled, and ignores source values when the timer
 * is enabled. Initially, the timer is disabled. As soon as the first source
 * value arrives, it is forwarded to the output Observable, and then the timer
 * is enabled. After `duration` milliseconds (or the time unit determined
 * internally by the optional `scheduler`) has passed, the timer is disabled,
 * and this process repeats for the next source value. Optionally takes a
 * {@link SchedulerLike} for managing timers.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * #### Limit click rate
 *
 * Emit clicks at a rate of at most one click per second
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
 * import { throttleTime } from 'rxjs/operators';
 *
 * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * const result = clicks.pipe(throttleTime(1000));
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```
 *
 * #### Double Click
 *
 * The following example only emits clicks which happen within a subsequent
 * delay of 400ms of the previous click. This for example can emulate a double
 * click. It makes use of the `trailing` parameter of the throttle configuration.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent, asyncScheduler } from 'rxjs';
 * import { throttleTime, withLatestFrom } from 'rxjs/operators';
 *
 * // defaultThottleConfig = { leading: true, trail
