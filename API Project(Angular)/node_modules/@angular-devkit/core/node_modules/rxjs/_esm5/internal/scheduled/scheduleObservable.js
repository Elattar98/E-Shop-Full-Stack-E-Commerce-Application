ec, source maps have the
following attributes:

* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.

* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.

* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referenced by individual
  mappings.

* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.

* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.

* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.

* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.

The promise of the constructed souce map consumer is returned.

When the `SourceMapConsumer` will no longer be used anymore, you must call its
`destroy` method.

```js
const consumer = await new sourceMap.SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMapJsonData);
doStuffWith(consumer);
consumer.destroy();
```

Alternatively, you can use `SourceMapConsumer.with` to avoid needing to remember
to call `destroy`.
