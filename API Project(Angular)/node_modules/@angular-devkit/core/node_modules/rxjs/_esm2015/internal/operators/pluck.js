### Multiple transformations of a file

As a convenience, if you have multiple single-source transformations of a file, you may pass an
array of sourcemap files in the order of most-recent transformation sourcemap first. Note that this

const remapped = remapping(
  [minifiedTransformedMap, transformedMap],
  () => null
);

console.log(remapped);
// {
//   file: 'transpiled.min.js',
//   mappings: 'AAEE',
//   sources: ['helloworld.js'],

### Advanced control of the loading graph

The `source` property can overridden to any value to
