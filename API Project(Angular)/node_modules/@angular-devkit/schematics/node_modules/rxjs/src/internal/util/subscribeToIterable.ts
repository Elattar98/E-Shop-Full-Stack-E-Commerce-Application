`Map`
 * and its descendants become mappings, while arrays and other iterable objects
 * result in sequences.
 *
 * The primary purpose of this function is to enable attaching comments or other
 * metadata to a value, or to otherwise exert more fine-grained control over the
 * stringified output. To that end, you'll need to assign its return value to
 * the `contents` of a Document (or somewhere within said contents), as the
 * document's schema is required for YAML string output.
 *
 * @param wrapScalars If undefined or `true`, also wraps plain values in
 *   `Scalar` objects; if `false` and `value` is not an object, it will be
 *   returned directly.
 * @param tag Use to specify the collection type, e.g. `"!!omap"`. Note that
 *   this requires the corresponding tag to be available based on the default
 *   options.
