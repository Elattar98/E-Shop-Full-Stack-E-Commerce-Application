/**
 * `ConstantPool` tries to reuse literal factories when two or more literals are identical.
 * We determine whether literals are identical by creating a key out of their AST using the
 * `KeyVisitor`. This constant is used to replace dynamic expressions which can't be safely
 * converted into a key. E.g. given an expression `{foo: bar()}`, since we don't know what
 * the result of `bar` will be, we create a key that looks like `{foo: <unknown>}`. Note
 * that we use a variable, rather than something like `null` in order to avoid collisions.
