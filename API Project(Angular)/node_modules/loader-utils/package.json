/**
 * Subscribes to the source, and the observable inputs provided as arguments, and combines their values, by index, into arrays.
 *
 * What is meant by "combine by index": The first value from each will be made into a single array, then emitted,
 * then the second value from each will be combined into a single array and emitted, then the third value
 * from each will be combined into a single array and emitted, and so on.
 *
 * This will continue until it is no longer able to combine values of the same index into an array.
 *
 * After the last value from any one completed source is emitted in an array, the resulting observable will complete,
 * as there is no way to continue "zipping" values together by index.
