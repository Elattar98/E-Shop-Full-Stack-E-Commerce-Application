 * Compares all values of two observables in sequence using an optional comparator function

 *
 * `sequenceEqual` subscribes to two observables and buffers incoming values from each observable. Whenever either
 * observable emits a value, the value is buffered and the buffers are shifted and compared from the bottom
 * up; If any value pair doesn't match, the returned observable will emit `false` and complete. If one of the
 * observables completes, the operator will wait for the other observable to complete; If the other
 * observable emits before completing, the returned observable will emit `false` and complete. If one observable never
 * completes or emits after the
