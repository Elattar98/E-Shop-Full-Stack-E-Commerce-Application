/**
 * If `with` is provided, this will return an observable that will switch to a different observable if the source
 * does not push values within the specified time parameters.
 *
 * <span class="informal">The most flexible option for creating a timeout behavior.</span>
 *
 * The first thing to know about the configuration is if you do not provide a `with` property to the configuration,
 * when timeout conditions are met, this operator will emit a {@link TimeoutError}. Otherwise, it will use the factory
 * function provided by `with`, and switch your subscription to the result of that. Timeout conditions are provided by
 * the settings in `first` and `each`.
 *
 * The `first` property can be either a `Date` for a specific time, a `number` for a time period relative to the
 * point of subscription, or it can be skipped. This property is to check timeout conditions for the arrival of
 * the first value from the source _only_. The timings of all subsequent values  from the source will be checked
 * against the time period provided by `each`, if it was provided.
 *
 * The `each` property can be either a `number` or skipped. If a value for `each` is provided, it represents the amount of
 * time the resulting observable will wait between the arrival of values from the source before timing out. Note that if
 * `first` is _not_ provided, the value from `each` will be used to check timeout conditions for the arrival of the first
 * value and all subsequent values. If `first` _is_ provided, `each` will only be use to check all values after the first.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * Emit a custom error if there is too much time between values
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { interval, timeout, throwError } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * class CustomTimeoutError extends Error {
 *   constructor() {
 *     super('It was too slow');
 *     this.name = 'CustomTimeoutError';
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * const slow$ = interval(900);
 *
 * slow$.pipe(
 *   timeout({
 *     each: 1000,
 *     with: () => throwError(() => new CustomTimeoutError())
 *   })
 * )
 * .subscribe({
 *   error: console.error
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Switch to a faster observable if your source is slow.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { interval, timeout } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const slow$ = interval(900);
 * const fast$ = interval(500);
 *
 * slow$.pipe(
 *   timeout({
 *     each: 1000,
 *     with: () => fast$,
 *   })
 * )
 * .subscribe(console.log);
 * ```
 * @param config The configuration for the timeout.
