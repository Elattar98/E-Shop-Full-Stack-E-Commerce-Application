     * <em>This will require a polyfill for `URL` and `URLSearchParams` in Internet Explorer!</em>
     *
     * Accepts either a query string, a `URLSearchParams` object, a dictionary of key/value pairs, or an
     * array of key/value entry tuples. (Essentially, it takes anything that `new URLSearchParams` would normally take).
     *
     * If, for some reason you have a query string in the `url` argument, this will append to the query string in the url,
     * but it will also overwrite the value of any keys that are an exact match. In other words, a url of `/test?a=1&b=2`,
     * with queryParams of `{ b: 5, c: 6 }` will result in a url of roughly `/test?a=1&b=5&c=6`.
