/**
 * Flattens an Observable-of-Observables by applying {@link combineLatest} when the Observable-of-Observables completes.
 *
 * `combineLatestAll` takes an Observable of Observables, and collects all Observables from it. Once the outer Observable completes,
 * it subscribes to all collected Observables and combines their values using the {@link combineLatest} strategy, such that:
 *
 * * Every time an inner Observable emits, the output Observable emits
 * * When the returned observable emits, it emits all of the latest values by:
 *    * If a `project` function is provided, it is called with each recent value from each inner Observable in whatever order they
 *      arrived, and the result of the `project` function is what is emitted by the output Observable.
 *    * If there is no `project` function, an array of all the most recent values is emitted by the output Observable.
 *
