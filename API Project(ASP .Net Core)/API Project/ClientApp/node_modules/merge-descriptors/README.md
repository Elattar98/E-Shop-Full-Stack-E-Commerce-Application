/**
 * Applies an accumulator function over the source Observable where the
 * accumulator function itself returns an Observable, then each intermediate
 * Observable returned is merged into the output Observable.
 *
 * <span class="informal">It's like {@link scan}, but the Observables returned
 * by the accumulator are merged into the outer Observable.</span>
 *
 * The first parameter of the `mergeScan` is an `accumulator` function which is
 * being called every time the source Observable emits a value. `mergeScan` will
 * subscribe to the value returned by the `accumulator` function and will emit
 * values to the subscriber emitted by inner Observable.
 *
 * The `accumulator` function is being called with three parameters passed to it:
 * `acc`, `value` and `index`. The `acc` parameter is used as the state parameter
 * whose value is initially set to the `seed` parameter (the second parameter
 * passed to the `mergeScan` operator).
 *
 * `mergeScan` internally keeps the value of the `acc` parameter: as long as the
 * source Observable emits
