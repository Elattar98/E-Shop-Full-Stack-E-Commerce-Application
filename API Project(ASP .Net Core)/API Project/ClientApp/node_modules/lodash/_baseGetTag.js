/**
 * Emits an object containing the current value, and the time that has
 * passed between emitting the current value and the previous value, which is
 * calculated by using the provided `scheduler`'s `now()` method to retrieve
 * the current time at each emission, then calculating the difference. The `scheduler`
 * defaults to {@link asyncScheduler}, so by default, the `interval` will be in
 * milliseconds.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Convert an Observable that emits items into one that
 * emits indications of the amount of time elapsed between those emissions.</
