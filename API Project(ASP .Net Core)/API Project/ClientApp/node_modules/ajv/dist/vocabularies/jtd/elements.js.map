roperties: `initialState`,
 * `condition`, `iterate` and `resultSelector`, which should have respective values that you
 * would normally pass to `generate`. `resultSelector` is still optional, but that form
 * of calling `generate` allows you to omit `condition` as well. If you omit it, that means
 * condition always holds, so output Observable will never complete.
 *
 * Both forms of `generate` can optionally accept a scheduler. In case of multi-parameter call,
 * scheduler simply comes as a last argument (no matter if there is resultSelector
 * function or not). In case of single-parameter call, you can provide it as a
 * `scheduler` property on object passed to the operator. In both cases scheduler decides when
 * next iteration of the loop will happen and therefore when next value will be emitted
 * by the Observable. For example to ensure that each value is pushed to the observer
