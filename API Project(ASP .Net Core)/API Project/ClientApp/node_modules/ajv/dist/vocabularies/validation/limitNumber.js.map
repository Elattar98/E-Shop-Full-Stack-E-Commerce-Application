- **reduce:** index will properly start at 1 if no seed is provided, to match native Array reduce behavior ([30a4ca4](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/commit/30a4ca4)), closes [#2290](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/issues/2290)
- **repeatWhen:** resulting observable will wait for the source to complete, even if a hot notifier completes first. ([#2209](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/issues/2209)) ([c65a098](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/commit/c65a098)), closes [#2054](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/issues/2054)
- **Subject:** ensure subject properly throws ObjectUnsubscribedError when unsubscribed then resubscribed to ([#2318](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/issues/2318)) ([41489eb](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/commit/41489eb))

- **windowTime:** ensure windows created when only a timespan is passed are closed and cleaned up properly. ([#2278](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/issues/2278)) ([d4533c4](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/commit/d4533c4))
