promiseSpawn('ls', [ '-laF', 'some/dir/*.js' ], {
  cwd: '/tmp/some/path', // defaults to process.cwd()
  stdioString: false, // stdout/stderr as strings rather than buffers
  stdio: 'pipe', // any node spawn stdio arg is valid here
  // any other arguments to node child_process.spawn can go here as well,
}, {
  extra: 'things',
  to: 'decorate',
  the: 'result',
}).then(result => {
  // {code === 0, signal === null, stdout, stderr, and all the extras}
  console.log('ok!', result)
}).catch(er => {
  // er has all the same properties as the result, set appropria
