/**
 * Attaches a timestamp to each item emitted by an observable indicating when it was emitted
 *
 * The `timestamp` operator maps the *source* observable stream to an object of type
 * `{value: T, timestamp: R}`. The properties are generically typed. The `value` property contains the value
 * and type of the *source* observable. The `timestamp` is generated by the schedulers `now` function. By
 * default it uses the *async* scheduler which simply returns `Date.now()` (milliseconds since 1970/01/01
 * 00:00:00:000) and therefore is of type `number`
