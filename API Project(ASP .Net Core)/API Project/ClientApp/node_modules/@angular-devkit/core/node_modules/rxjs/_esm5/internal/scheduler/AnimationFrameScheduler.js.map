 * `sequenceEqual` subscribes to two observables and buffers incoming values from each observable. Whenever either
 * observable emits a value, the value is buffered and the buffers are shifted and compared from the bottom
 * up; If any value pair doesn't match, the returned observable will emit `false` and complete. If one of the
 * observables complet
