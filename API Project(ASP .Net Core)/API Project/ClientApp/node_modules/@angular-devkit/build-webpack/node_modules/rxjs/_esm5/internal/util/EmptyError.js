> Detect whether the terminal supports Unicode

This can be useful to decide whether to use Unicode characters or fallback ASCII characters in command-line output.

Note that the check is quite naive. It just assumes all non-Windows terminals support Unicode and hard-codes which Windows terminals that do support Unicode. However, I have been using this logic in some popular packages for years without problems.
