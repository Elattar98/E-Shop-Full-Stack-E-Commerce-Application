/**
 * An injectable service for executing work inside or outside of the Angular zone.
 *
 * The most common use of this service is to optimize performance when starting a work consisting of
 * one or more asynchronous tasks that don't require UI updates or error handling to be handled by
 * Angular. Such tasks can be kicked off via {@link #runOutsideAngular} and if needed, these tasks
 * can reenter the Angular zone via {@link #run}.
 *
 * <!-- TODO: add/fix links to:
 *   - docs explaining zones and the use of zones in Angular and change-detection
 *   - link to runOutsideAngular/run (throughout this file!)
 *   -->
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * import {Component, NgZone} from '@angular/core';
 * import {NgIf} from '@angular/common';
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'ng-zone-demo',
 *
