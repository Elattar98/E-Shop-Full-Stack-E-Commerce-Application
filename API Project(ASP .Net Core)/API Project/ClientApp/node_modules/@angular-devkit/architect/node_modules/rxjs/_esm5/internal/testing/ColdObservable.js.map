 * Stores meta-data for a property binding to be used by TestBed's `DebugElement.properties`.
 *
 * In order to support TestBed's `DebugElement.properties` we need to save, for each binding:
 * - a bound property name;
 * - a static parts of interpolated strings;
 *
 * A given property metadata is saved at the binding's index in the `TView.data` (in other words, a
 * property binding metadata will be stored in `TView.data` at the same index as a bound value in
 * `LView`). Metadata are represented as `INTERPOLATION_DELIMITER`-delimited string with the
 * following format:
 * - `propertyName` for bound properties;
 * - `propertyName�prefix�interpolation_static_part1�..interpolation_static_partN�suffix` for
 * interpolated properties.

 * @param tData `TData` where meta-data will be saved;
 * @param tNode `TNode` that is a target of the binding;
 * @param propertyName bound property name;
 * @param bindingIndex binding index in `LView`
 * @param interpolationParts static interpolation parts (for property interpolations)
