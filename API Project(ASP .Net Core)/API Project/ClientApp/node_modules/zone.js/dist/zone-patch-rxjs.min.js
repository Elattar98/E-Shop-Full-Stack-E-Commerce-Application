### BREAKING CHANGES

- Notification: `Notification.prototype.exception` is now `Notification.prototype.error` to match Rx4 semantics
- Symbol.iterator: RxJS will no longer polyfill `Symbol.iterator` if `Symbol` does not exist. This may break code that inadvertently relies on this behavior
- Object.assign: RxJS will no longer polyfill `Object.assign`. It does
  not require `Object.assign` to function, however, your code may be
  inadvertently relying on this polyfill.
- AjaxObservable: Observable.ajax.getJSON() now only supports a single type parameter,
  `getJSON<T>(url: string, headers?: Object): Observable<T>`.
  The extra type parameter it accepted previously was superfluous.
- distinct: `distinctKey` has been removed. Use `distinct`
- distinct: `distinct` operator has changed, first argument is an
  optional `keySelector`. The custom `compare` function is no longer
  supported.
