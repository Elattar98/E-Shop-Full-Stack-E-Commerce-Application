/**
 * Returns the matching `LContext` data for a given DOM node, directive or component instance.
 *
 * This function will examine the provided DOM element, component, or directive instance\'s
 * monkey-patched property to derive the `LContext` data. Once called then the monkey-patched
 * value will be that of the newly created `LContext`.
 *
 * If the monkey-patched value is the `LView` instance then the context value for that
 * target will be created and the monkey-patch reference will be updated. Therefore when this
 * function is called it may mutate the provided element\'s, component\'s or any of the associated
 * directive\'s monkey-patch values.
 *
 * If the monkey-patch value is not detected then the code will walk up the DOM until an element
 * is found which contains a monkey-patch reference. When that occurs then the provided element
 * will be updated with a new context (which is then returned). If the monkey-patch value is not
 * detected for a component/directive instance then it will throw an error (all components and
 * directives should be automatically monkey-patched by ivy).
 *
 * @param target Component, Directive or DOM Node.
