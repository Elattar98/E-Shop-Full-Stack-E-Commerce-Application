/**
 *
 * Queue Scheduler
 *
 * <span class="informal">Put every next task on a queue, instead of executing it immediately</span>
 *
 * `queue` scheduler, when used with delay, behaves the same as {@link asyncScheduler} scheduler.
 *
 * When used without delay, it schedules given task synchronously - executes it right when
 * it is scheduled. However when called recursively, that is when inside the scheduled task,
 * another task is scheduled with queue scheduler, instead of executing immediately
