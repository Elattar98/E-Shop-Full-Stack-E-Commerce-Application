/**
 * Splits the source Observable into two, one with values that satisfy a
 * predicate, and another with values that don't satisfy the predicate.
 *
 * <span class="informal">It's like {@link filter}, but returns two Observables:
 * one like the output of {@link filter}, and the other with values that did not
 * pass the condition.</span>
 *
 * ![](partition.png)
 *
 * `partition` outputs an array with two Observables that partition the values
 * from the source Observable through the given `predicate` function. The first
 * Observable in that array emits source values for which the predicate argument
 * returns true. The second Observable emits source values for which the
 * predicate returns false. The first behaves like {@link filter} and the second
 * behaves like {@link filter} with the predicate negated.
 *
 * ## Example
 * Partition a set of numbers into odds and evens observ
