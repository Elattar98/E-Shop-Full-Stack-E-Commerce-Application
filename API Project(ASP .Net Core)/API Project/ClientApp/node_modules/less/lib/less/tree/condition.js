     * ### Example
     *
     * The following example defines a component with a large list of readonly data.
     * Imagine the data changes constantly, many times per second. For performance reasons,
     * we want to check and update the list every five seconds. We can do that by detaching
     * the component's change detector and doing a local check every five seconds.
     *
     * ```typescript
     * class DataProvider {
     *   // in a real application the returned data will be different every time
     *   get data() {
     *     return [1,2,3,4,5];
     *   }
     * }
     *
     * @Component({
     *   selector: 'giant-list',
     *   template: `
     *     <li *ngFor="let d of dataProvider.data">Data {{d}}</li>
     *   `,
     * })
     * class GiantList {
     *   constructor(private ref: ChangeDetectorRef, private dataProvi
