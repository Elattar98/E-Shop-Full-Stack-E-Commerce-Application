- **utils:** Many internal use utilities like `isArray` are now hidden under `rxjs/internal`, they are implementation details and should not be used.
- **testing observables:** `HotObservable` and `ColdObservable`, and other testing support types are no longer exported directly.
- **creation functions:** All create functions such as `of`, `from`, `combineLatest` and `fromEvent` should now be imported from `rxjs/create`.
- **types and interfaces:** Can no longer explicitly import types from `rxjs/interfaces`, import them from `rxjs` instead
- **symbols:** Symbols are no longer exported directly from modules such as `rxjs/symbol/observable` please use `Symbol.observable` and `Symbol.iterator` (polyfills may be required)
- **deep imports:** Can no longer deep import top-level types such as `rxjs/Observable`, `rxjs/Subject`, `rxjs/ReplaySubject`, et al. All imports should be done directly from `rxjs`, for example: `import \{ Observable, Subject \} from 'rxjs';`
- **schedulers:** Scheduler instances have changed names to be suffixed with `Scheduler`, (e.g. `asap` -> `asapScheduler`)
- **operators:** Pipeable operators must now be imported from `rxjs`
  like so: `import { map, filter, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';`. No deep imports.
- **ajax:** Ajax observable should be imported from `rxjs/ajax`.
- **Observable:** You should no longer deep import custom Observable
  implementations such as `ArrayObservable` or `ForkJoinObservable`.
- **\_throw:** `_throw` is now exported as `throwError`
- **if:** `if` is now exported as `iif`
- **operators:** Deep imports to `rxjs/operator/*` will no longer work. Again, pipe operators are still where they were.
- **error handling:** Unhandled errors are no longer caught and rethrown, rather they are caught and scheduled to be thrown, which causes them to be reported to window.onerror or process.on('error'), depending on the environment. Consequently, teardown after a synchronous, unhandled, error will no longer occur, as the teardown would not exist, and producer interference cannot occur
- **distinct:** Using `distinct` requires a `Set` implementation and must be polyfilled in older runtimes
- **asap:** Old runtimes must polyfill Promise in order to use ASAP scheduling.
- **groupBy:** Older runtimes will require Map to be polyfilled to use
  `groupBy`
