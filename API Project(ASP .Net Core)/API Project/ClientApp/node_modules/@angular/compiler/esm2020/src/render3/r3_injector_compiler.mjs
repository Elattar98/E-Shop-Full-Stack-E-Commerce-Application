cast:** support returning union types from projection ([e9e9041](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/e9e9041))
- **exhaustMap:** support returning union types from projection ([ff1f5dc](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/ff1f5dc))
- **merge:** support union type inference for merge operators ([c2ac39c](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/c2ac39c))
- **catchError:** support union type returns ([8350622](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/8350622))
- **switchMap:** support union type returns ([32d35fd](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/32d35fd))
- **defer:** support union types passed ([5aea50e](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/5aea50e))
- **race:** Update typings to support proper return types ([#4465](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/issues/4465)) ([0042846](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/0042846))
- **VirtualTimeScheduler:** rework flush so it won't lose actions ([#4433](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/issues/4433)) ([d068bc9](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/d068bc9))
- **WebSocketSubject:** fix subject failing to close socket ([#4446](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/issues/4446)) ([dcfa52b](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/dcfa52b))

### Features

- **shareReplay:** Add configuration object for named arguments, and add argument to support unsubscribing from source observable by `refCount` when all resulting subscriptions have unsubscribed. The default behavior is to leave the source subscription running.
- **mergeScan:** Add index to the accumulator function ([#4458](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/issues/4458)) ([f5e143d](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/f5e143d)), closes [#4441](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/issues/4441)
- **range:** accept one argument ([#4360](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/issues/4360)) ([a388578](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/a388578))
- **takeWhile:** add an `inclusive` option to the operator which causes to emit final value ([#4115](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/issues/4115)) ([6e7f407](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/6e7f407))

### Performance Improvements

- **internal:** optimize Subscription#add() for the common case ([#4489](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/issues/4489)) ([bdd201c](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/bdd201c))
- **internal:** use strict equality for isObject() ([#4493](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/issues/4493)) ([fc84a00](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/fc84a00))
- **Subscription:** use `instanceof` to avoid megamorphic LoadIC ([#4499](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/issues/4499)) ([065b4e3](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/065b4e3))

- **Subscriber:** use only local Subscriber instances ([50ee0a7](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/50ee0a7))
- **TypeScript:** ensure RxJS builds with TS@next as well ([f03e790](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/f03e790))
