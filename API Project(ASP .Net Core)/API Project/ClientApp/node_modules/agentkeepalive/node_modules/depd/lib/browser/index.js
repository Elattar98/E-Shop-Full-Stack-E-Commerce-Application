/**
 * Creates an Observable that uses a resource which will be disposed at the same time as the Observable.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Use it when you catch yourself cleaning up after an Observable.</span>
 *
 * `using` is a factory operator, which accepts two functions. First function returns a disposable resource.
 * It can be an arbitrary object that implements `unsubscribe` method. Second function will be injected with
 * that object and should return an Observable. That Observable can use resource object during its execution.
 * Both functions passed to `using` will be called every time someone subscribes - neither an Observable nor
 * resource object will be shared in any way between subscriptions.
 *
 * When Observable returned by `using` is subscribed, Observable returned from the second function will be subscribed
 * as well. All its notifications (nexted values, completion and error events) will be emitted unchanged by the output
 * Observable. If however someone unsubscribes from the Observable or source Observable completes or errors by itself,
 * the `unsubscribe` method on resource object will be called. This can be used to do any necessary clean up, which
 * otherwise would have to be handled by hand. Note that complete or error notifications are not emitted when someone
 * cancel
